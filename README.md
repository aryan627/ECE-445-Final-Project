# ECE-445-Final-Project
Adaptive Response Digital Guitar Pedal
Project Overview
This project is part of the ECE 445 Final Project. We are developing an adaptive response digital guitar pedal that dynamically adjusts sound effects based on the player's input. The pedal aims to simulate the dynamic response of tube amplifiers, providing a versatile, modern solution for musicians.

Project Goals
Build a guitar pedal that responds to input volume by adjusting effects.
Minimize signal processing latency to ensure real-time performance (<12ms delay).
Ensure safety and proper insulation for low-voltage operations.
